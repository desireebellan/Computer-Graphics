## Description
The project consists in the implementation of two extensions for the Yocto/GL library: the first one is an hair shader built upon the work of Matt Pharr [1], the second one a geometry processing tool based on Monte Carlo estimators [2], used to solve Partial Derivative Equations (PDEs) in a convenient and intuitive way and developed as an alternative to other mesh-based techniques, such as the Finite Elements Method (FEM).
